Data Analytics Daily Lessons

Today’s Focus: Advanced Business Analytics + Optimization + Real-World Case Study

📘 Lesson 1: Cohort Analysis for Business Retention
======================================================
Summary:
Cohort analysis groups users by a common event (signup month, first purchase) to understand retention patterns across cohorts.

Example:
Jan Cohort: 1000 users → 400 returned in Feb → retention = 40%
Feb Cohort: 1200 users → 300 returned in Mar → retention = 25%
➡️ Helps companies identify strong/weak acquisition channels.

📘 Lesson 2: RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
=========================================================
Summary:
RFM helps segment customers based on:
Recency: How recently a customer purchased
Frequency: How often they purchase
Monetary: How much revenue they generate

Example:
Customer	R	F	M	Segment
A	5	4	5	VIP
B	2	1	1	At-risk
C	3	2	3	Regular

📘 Lesson 3: Forecasting with Moving Averages & Exponential Smoothing
=========================================================================
Summary:
Used for sales, inventory, traffic, and trend forecasting.
Moving Average Example
Past 3 months sales: 100, 120, 130
3-month moving average forecast = (100 + 120 + 130) / 3 = 116.7
Exponential Smoothing
Forecast = α × Actual + (1 − α) × Previous Forecast

📘 Lesson 4: Optimization Using Solver (Excel / Python)
=========================================================
Summary:
Optimization chooses the best possible solution under given constraints.

Example:
A delivery company wants to minimize fuel cost while meeting all delivery times.
You define:
Objective → minimize total cost
Constraints → vehicle capacity, time, distance
Excel Solver or Python PuLP can solve it.
